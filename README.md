Logos Initiative
================

This project hosts the website and blog of the Logos Initiative.

The Logos Initiative is an organizational fork of the The Loglan Institute (TLI) and the Logical Language Group (LLG) and their respective Loglan and Lojban languages. The Initiative has been created for the purpose of reconciling the differences between these two languages, to create a new hybrid language called [Logla Prime](http://github.com/LogosInitiative/logla), and then manage the natural never ending process of evolution of this language. The overarching goal is to continue the original, if only implicit, mission set out by the the two prior projects: the perfection of human language.

Unlike Loglan, the Logla is 100% open source, all material is copyleft, and anyone can participate in development of the language. Unlike Lojban, the Logla is a dynamic changing language. Dialects (variant Logla) are warmly welcomed. The best features of dialects may find there way to the mainline language. Changes to the mainline language are decided by long and rigorous debate, and ultimately by unanimous approval of supervisory chairs.

Github project management tools will play an important part in the language's development. The issue tracker will be used to propose and debate ideas. And the Github's wiki will be used to write up detailed formal proposals as needed.

As the language evolves, baselines will be established as required. These will be considered complete dialects of the language and given specific names. These baselines can then evolve on their own if enough people are invested in them.

Discussions about the Logos Initiative and Logla are held in the [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/logla).
